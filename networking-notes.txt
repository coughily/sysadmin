Getting the system on to the network required modifying the following configuration files, due to the lack of the NetworkManager utility on our system...
(Presumably because of the "minimal" install)

#/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
NM_CONTROLLED=no
IPADDR=(set to the ip)
NETMASK=255.255.255.0

#/etc/sysconfig/network
HOSTNAME=(the hostname.domain)
GATEWAY=(the gateway)

#/etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain (etc)

#/etc/resolv.conf
nameserver (nameserver 1)
nameserver (nameserver 2)
nameserver (nameserver 3)

#TO DO: add route configuration
