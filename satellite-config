In order to register the system with the UO RHN Satellite, I followed the steps outlined here:
https://it.uoregon.edu/systems/doc/rhn/start

Basically it boils down to:
1. finding the Finance/Admin activation key (since we are already setup in this sytem with registered boxes)
2. downloading the bootstrap script and modifying it to use that activation key

This was a much better way to go when compared with following the "client configuration" instructions available
from our RedHat Customer Portal, which do not assume a nifty script is available to do the heavy lifting.


I downloaded the bootstrap.sh script, and modified it to include the proper activation key.

In messing with this, I was reminded that I still hadn't configured our system to allow davidr and mcoughli to use sudo.
In order to run the script then, I became root
$ su
and then executed the script
$ bash boostrap.sh

The script worked its magic.
Note that I did configure it *not* to update immediately upon successfully registering with the Satellite, it does appear to have installed/updated:
rhel-x86_64-server-6/primary
I assume this is a standard dependency thing, but I have not looked it up yet.

I then attempted to remedy the "sudoers" issue, so that davidr and mcoughli would be able to execute yum check-update and begin to plan the package update process
$ su
$ visudo
Added the following lines to the file:
davidr ALL=(ALL) ALL
mcoughli ALL=(ALL) ALL

Saved.

$ exit (to log out of root)
$ sudo yum check-update

The update check worked.  Interestingly enough it shows more available updates than does the customer portal (rhn.uoregon.edu)
Need to check that out...

The available_updates.txt shows the output of the command
